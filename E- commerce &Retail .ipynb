## Future Enhancement
1. Dynamic Credit Policy Implementation
Develop a dynamic credit policy system based on customer cluster behavior (0, 1, 2). Automate stricter policies for cluster 1 (prolonged payment customers), such as earlier payment reminders, customized repayment plans, or penalties. Introduce incentives for early-payment customers (cluster 2), such as discounts or loyalty rewards.

2. Real-time Monitoring and Alerts
Implement real-time dashboards to monitor delayed payments by invoice type (Credit Note, Goods, etc.) and customer clusters. Set up automated alerts for overdue payments, categorized by invoice type and payment delay duration.

3. Predictive Analytics for Risk Assessment
Use machine learning models to predict payment delays based on historical transaction data, invoice types, and customer profiles. Include features like invoice value, payment history, and frequency to predict high-risk customers or transactions.

4. Segmentation Refinement
Explore additional clustering techniques like DBSCAN or Gaussian Mixture Models to refine customer segmentation further. Incorporate demographic or geographic features to better understand customer behavior across regions.

5. Behavioral Analysis
Analyze trends in payment delays over time to identify seasonal patterns or specific periods with higher risks. Study the impact of policy changes or penalties on customer payment behavior and refine strategies accordingly.

6. Integration with Financial Systems
Integrate clustering results with existing ERP or accounting systems for seamless implementation of payment policies and automated follow-ups. Link to customer relationship management (CRM) systems to provide better customer support for delayed payments.

7. In-depth Analysis of Low-Value Payments
Conduct a deeper analysis of low-value payment delays to identify root causes, such as operational inefficiencies or customer challenges. Evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of penalties for low-value delays by simulating scenarios and measuring customer response.

8. Policy Simulation and Optimization
Develop simulation models to test the impact of proposed penalties and stricter policies on overall revenue and customer retention. Use optimization techniques to find the balance between maximizing revenue and minimizing customer dissatisfaction.

9. Customer Feedback Integration
Collect feedback from customers regarding payment policies and delays. Use sentiment analysis on feedback data to identify pain points and improve payment terms.

10. Visualization and Reporting Enhancements
Provide interactive visualizations, such as payment delay heatmaps, customer cluster trends, or invoice type performance. Create automated periodic reports to share insights with stakeholders for decision-making.
