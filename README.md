E-Commerce &amp; Retail 

Overview

This case study focuses on understanding and predicting customer payment behaviour in the e-commerce/retail domain. By analyzing historical payment data, we aim to:

Recognize customer payment patterns.

Predict the likelihood of delayed payments for open invoices.

Segment customers into actionable categories to improve payment follow-up strategies.

Key Objectives

Customer Segmentation: Identify and cluster customers based on their payment behaviour.

Predictive Modelling: Build models to predict delayed payments.

Business Insights: Provide actionable recommendations to streamline payment collection processes.

Workflow

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed detailed analysis of historical payment data to understand trends, anomalies, and correlations.

Key metrics examined include:

Payment delays

Frequency of on-time vs. delayed payments

Customer payment history patterns

2. Customer Segmentation

Applied the K-Means clustering technique to segment customers into three categories:

Prime Customers: Consistently pay on time.

General Customers: Occasionally delay payments.

Problematic Customers: Frequently delay or default on payments.

3. Predictive Modelling

Built two predictive models to estimate the likelihood of delayed payments:

Logistic Regression: For its interpretability and baseline comparisons.

Random Forest Classifier: For improved accuracy and handling non-linear relationships.
